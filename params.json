Nothing any science fiction author could ever write about mind reading could be as amazing, intricate, or subtle as speech.  This course introduces students to the study of speech production and perception and the nature of the acoustic signal that is transmitted from speaker to listener.\r\n\r\n## Course Goals\r\n\r\n- To understand fundamental principles of phonetic theory and phonetic representation. We will study current theories of the complex tasks accomplished by speakers and listeners and will arrive at a representation of speech sounds in terms of their articulatory (speaker-based), acoustic, and perceptual (listener-based) characteristics.\r\n- To introduce students to phonetic experimentation and analysis.  Small-scale experiments will provide training in physiologic measurement, acoustic analysis and perceptual testing.  We will reinforce theoretical principles by performing empirical tests of claims.\r\n- To consider articulatory, acoustic and perceptual properties as imposing a set of simultaneous constraints on the notion of possible speech sound and as contributing to the definition of possible speech sound _system_ for human languages.  This consideration serves as a bridge from phonetics to phonology.\r\n- To provide practical experience in producing and transcribing sounds of the world's languages.\r\n\r\n## Learning Outcomes\r\n\r\nAfter diligent participation in this class, students will:\r\n\r\n- Have a basic understanding of articulatory phonetics and the physiology of speech\r\n- Have a basic understanding of the relationship between the sensory input of speech and our cognitive representations of that input\r\n- Be able to perform basic acoustic analysis of speech and interpret others' analyses\r\n- Be prepared to conduct independent research on topics in phonetics\r\n- Be able to transcribe, and read transcriptions of, human speech using the International Phonetic Alphabet and to understand the strengths and limitations of these transcriptions.\r\n\r\n## Required Textbooks\r\n\r\n1.  _Acoustic and Auditory Phonetics_ (3rd edition) by Keith Johnson ISBN: 1-4051-9466-9\r\n2. And _A Course in Phonetics_, one of:\r\n  - 6th edition by Peter Ladefoged \\& Keith Johnson ISBN: 1-4282-3126-9\r\n  - or 5th edition by Peter Ladefoged ISBN: 1-4130-0688-4)\r\n\r\nAdditional required readings will be on [our canvas site](https://uk.instructure.com/courses/1606720).\r\n\r\nDiscussions will parallel the readings but will not always cover the same material. *You are responsible for all material covered in readings and in class.*  Regular class attendance and active participation are essential for mastery of the material and will be reflected by your overall course grade.  Slides, when used, will be made available online, but serve only to support the discussion we'll have together in class. Our discussions, in a very real sense, _are_ the course and the more you participate the richer our course will be.\r\n\r\nWork | Grade contribution\r\n------|-------------------:\r\nHomework Assignments | 15%\r\nTranscription assignments | 15%\r\nMidterm exam | 20%\r\nFinal exam | 20%\r\nSemester Project | 30%\r\n\r\n## In-class Practice Transcription\r\n\r\nWe will devote 10 to 15 minutes of in-class time per week to transcription practice.  We will practice hearing and transcribing sounds together -- beginning with English consonants and advancing through the entire IPA.\r\n\r\n## Practice Transcription Assignments\r\n\r\nTranscription, like any skill, can only be acquired through practice.  Moreover, it is essential that you contemplate your errors and understand why you are making them.  What do you tend to mishear?  Why might this be the case?\r\n  Over the course of the semester there will be five (5) practice transcription assignments worth 15\\% of the final grade.  These are ungraded but compulsory.  Please, I beg you, do all of these.\r\n\r\nEach of these transcription assignments will have three phases:\r\n\r\n- You download and complete the assignment, like any homework.\r\n- I give you the key for the assignment and you grade your own work.  I encourage you to collaborate with 1 to 3 friends on this phase.\r\n- You write a brief analysis of the ways in which your initial transcriptions differ from the key.  Do you see any systematic differences?  What aspects of the production and perception of human speech might have led to these differences?  This analysis, along with your original, graded transcription, is what you will ultimately hand-in to me.\r\n\r\n## Homework Information\r\n\r\nHomework sheets will be available for download from canvas at least 1 week before their due date.\r\n\r\nCompleted homeworks are to be uploaded to canvas; hardcopy assignments will not be accepted.  Note that completed assignments should be submitted in plain text or PDF format *only*.  We will not accept Word files.\r\n\r\n## Late Homework Policy\r\nThese are not going to be the kind of homework assignments you can leave until the last second.  Phonetics is exacting and can be both difficult to think through and labor intensive.  Late homework will not be accepted without an approved excuse for, for example, illness or family emergency.  Alternate due dates can be arranged _in advance_ of the regular deadline if you have legitimate reasons for the request, such as  sports schedules.  Please consult with me during my office hours.\r\n\r\nIf you fail to meet a due date: upload your homework as soon as possible.  The system will allow the upload, but your file will be flagged as late. I will not grade homework marked as late unless you submit, and I approve, a signed, paper-based written request to have your late paper graded, including a brief description of why you think the submission deadline should be extended in your case.  You can hand your signed, written request directly to me or leave it under my office door.\r\n\r\n## Honor Policy\r\n\r\nAppropriating someone else's work and portraying it as your own is cheating.  Collaborating with someone and portraying that work as solely your own is cheating.  Obtaining answers to homework assignments or exams from previous semesters is cheating. Falsifying data or experimental results is cheating.  If you are caught cheating, you will be referred to the Honor Council.  If you are unsure about whether a specific action is cheating, you may check with your TA or the intstructor.  Some general guidelines are:\r\n\r\n- Do not look at notes, assignments, or exams from previous semesters.\r\n- Do not seek solutions to homework problems or exams from outside sources, including books (other than the textbook) or the internet.\r\n- Do not copy other (current or former) studentsÕ homework assignments. To minimize this temptation, always type up your homework answers by yourself, separately from your study group or other students in the class.\r\n- Once you have started to work on your acoustics or final exam, do not discuss it with other students, until after you have turned it in and the exam time is over.\r\n- Do not falsify data or other results in your homeworks or Extra Credit project.\r\n- Cite all sources used and cite and designate all quotations as such.\r\n\r\n## Study Groups\r\n\r\nI encourage students to form study groups to talk about readings and lectures, and especially to discuss and work through analyzing homework problems.  Invite me if you want and I'll try to come.  However, after you figure/argue them out together please type up your homework answers alone, separately from the other study group members.  It is usually easy to tell who has worked together and we will not grade identical answers gently.\r\n\r\n## Americans with Disabilities Act\r\n\r\n If any student in the class has a documented disability needing academic adjustments or accommodations, please get in touch with me during the first two weeks of class.  All discussions will remain confidential.  Students with disabilities will also need to contact Disability Support Services in the Ley Student Center.  I look forward to working with you to make this class enjoyable and accessible for all.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
